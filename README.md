# gaggle/deliverymetrics 0.1.3

## Binaries and MacOS Compatibility

Deliverymetrics binaries are available for download in the releases section of this project. 
However, please note these binaries are not signed, 
because Deliverymetrics is not a commercial product 
and so the costs associated with obtaining a signed certificate can't be justified at this time.

For MacOS users, 
this means you will need to follow a slightly different process
to open the application for the first time:

* Download the Deliverymetrics binary from the [releases] page.
* Locate the downloaded file in Finder.
* **Right-click on file and choose "Open"** from the context menu.
* A dialogue box will appear, warning you that the app is not signed. Click "Open" to proceed.
* The app will run in Terminal, 
  and because it's run without arguments, it'll just print its help. 
  You can close this window.

From this point forward,
MacOS will allow you to use the application normally.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
