# gaggle/deliverymetrics 0.1.7

## Binaries and MacOS Compatibility

Deliverymetrics binaries are available for download in the releases section of this project. 
However, please note these binaries are not signed, 
because the costs of obtaining a signed certificate can't be justified at this time.

For MacOS users, 
this means you will need to follow this process once before you can use the application:

* Download the Deliverymetrics binary from the [releases] page.
* Locate the downloaded file in Finder.
* **Right-click on file and choose "Open"** from the context menu.
* A dialogue box will appear, warning you that the app is not signed. Click "**Open**" to proceed.
* The app will run in Terminal, 
  and because it's run without arguments, it'll just print its help. 
  You can close this window.

From this point forward,
MacOS will allow you to use the application normally.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
